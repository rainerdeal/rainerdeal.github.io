title: Ricky Deal - About
---

I'm a software developer ðŸ’» from Washington, DC.

I grew up in [Shepherdstown](http://shepherdstown.info), WV, which is a very small town in the suburbs of DC. I graduated from [West Virginia University](https://www.wvu.edu) (Morgantown, WV) with a degree in computer science. Right now, I work as a web developer for [Marriott International](https://www.marriott.com/marriott/aboutmarriott.mi) and I absolutely love it!

You can usually find me somewhere downtown, maybe a coffee shop, maybe a rooftop, maybe a lounge... I spend a lot of my time in the underground house scene. I like to experience new music whenever I can. I also enjoy programming and tinkering with my raspbery pi.

A personal project that I have been working on is the [PRT Monitor](https://github.com/rainerdeal/PRT-Monitor). You can find more of my work in my portfolio and you can find my prose in Conversations With A Ghost.
