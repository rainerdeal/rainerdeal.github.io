I'm a software developer ðŸ’» in Washington, DC.

I grew up in [Shepherdstown](http://shepherdstown.info){:target="_blank"}, WV, and studied computer science at [West Virginia University](https://www.wvu.edu){:target="_blank"}. Now I'm a web developer in the [hospitality industry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospitality_industry){:target="_blank"}!

You can usually find me somewhere downtown, maybe a coffee shop, maybe a rooftop, or a lounge. I spend a lot of my time in the underground music scene. I like to experience new music whenever and wherever I can. I also enjoy programming and tinkering with my [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org){:target="_blank"}.

A personal project that I have been working on is the [PRT Monitor](http://www.thedaonline.com/news/bot-account-can-tell-when-prt-is-down-within-five/article_940d3182-ba3d-11e8-a305-d7d8e3af9f55.html){:target="_blank"}. You can find more of my work in my portfolio and you can find my prose in *Talking To Ghosts*. I wrote a little about the creation of this website and what it means to me in [this]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-10-23-Ghost-in-the-Shell %}) blog post.
