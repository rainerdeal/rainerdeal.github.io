I'm a software developer ðŸ’» from Washington, DC.

I grew up in [Shepherdstown](http://shepherdstown.info), WV, which is a very small town in the suburbs of DC and graduated from [West Virginia University](https://www.wvu.edu) (Morgantown, WV). Right now, I work as a web developer for [Marriott International](https://www.marriott.com/marriott/aboutmarriott.mi) and I absolutely love it!

You can usually find me somewhere downtown, maybe a coffee shop, maybe a rooftop, maybe a lounge, or warehouse... I spend a lot of my time in the underground house scene. I like to experience new music whenever & wherever I can. I also enjoy programming and tinkering with my raspbery pi.

A personal project that I have been working on is the [PRT Monitor](http://www.thedaonline.com/news/bot-account-can-tell-when-prt-is-down-within-five/article_940d3182-ba3d-11e8-a305-d7d8e3af9f55.html). You can find more of my work in my portfolio and you can find my prose in Conversations With A Ghost. I wrote a little about the creation of this website and what it means to me in [this]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-10-23-Ghost-in-the-Shell %}) blog post.
