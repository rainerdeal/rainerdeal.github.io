        <p>I'm a software developer ðŸ’» from Washington, DC.</p>
        <p>I grew up in <a href="http://shepherdstown.info">Shepherdstown</a>, WV, which is a very small town in the suburbs of DC. I graduated from <a href="https://www.wvu.edu">West Virginia University</a> (Morgantown, WV) with a degree in computer science. Right now, I work as a web developer for <a href="https://www.marriott.com/marriott/aboutmarriott.mi">Marriott International</a> and I absolutely love it!</p>
        <p>You can usually find me somewhere downtown, maybe a coffee shop, maybe a rooftop, maybe a lounge... I spend a lot of my time in the underground house scene. I like to experience new music whenever I can. I also enjoy programming and tinkering with my raspbery pi.</p>
        <p>A personal project that I have been working on is the <a href="https://github.com/rainerdeal/PRT-Monitor">PRT Monitor</a>. You can find more of my work in my portfolio and you can find my prose in Conversations With A Ghost.</p>
