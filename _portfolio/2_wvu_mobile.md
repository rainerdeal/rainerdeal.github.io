#### Background
When I began my college career at [West Virginia University](https://www.wvu.edu), there wasn't an official school app, yet (to be fair, it was very early in the mobile app world in 2011). There was an unofficial app, however, called [iWVU](http://jaredcrawford.org/iwvu/). iWVU served my friends and I well during our freshman year and it was packed with features. The developer ended up getting a job at Apple, which unfortunately means you cannot have an app on the App Store. And just like that, there was no WVU app available. I had become pretty dependant on the app's features and was also becoming interested in iOS development. When it came time for my senior design project, I already had my heart set on WVU Mobile.

#### Details:
WVU Mobile pulls together many different resources that WVU makes available including: News and events feeds, PRT status API, bus route details from Mountain Line Transit Authority, detailed map of campus, and more.

#### Features
* PRT - Use the PRT widget to check the PRT status without even opening the app! You can also check the PRT status right from WVU Mobile and see the PRT‚Äôs hours.
* Dining - Daily breakfast, lunch, and dinner menus for 6 campus dining halls including: Cafe Evansdale, Summit Cafe, Arnold‚Äôs Diner, Boreman Bistro, Terrace Room, Hatfields, and access to hours and locations of all 6 dining halls! Also, easy access to Mounty Bounty.
* News - Get the latest news from WVU Today and the Daily Athenaeum, right in the palm of your hand.
* Buses - Maps of 17 Mountain Line Bus routes. Includes detailed locations of each stop as well as hours of operation and quick access to the Twitter feed.
* Map - Detailed map of each of West Virginia University‚Äôs Morgantown campuses. Convenient markers for dorms, parking, and class buildings. Quickly search for your destination using the building code (ARM-D) or the full name of a building (Armstrong).
* Events - Quickly view events taking place on and around campus organized by day. Save your favorites to use later!
* Help - Useful phone numbers for 12 services on campus and in Morgantown, WV.
