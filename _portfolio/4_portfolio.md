#### Background
I originally made this website from scratch with HTML/CSS & Bootstrap and I had been hosting it on GitHub Pages because it was free. GitHub had been pushing Jekyll usage for a long time and one day I decided to try it. So I followed a guide for how to convert my website into a theme and then started removing the hard-coded content and putting it into Markdown and YAML files.

My long term goal is to make this theme available for others to use.

#### Details:
Conversations With A Ghost is a simple Jekyll theme for bloggers as well as a portfolio. It has a simple nav bar with straightforward options. It heavily features Bootstrap's card object as the main way to display portfolio items and blog posts.
