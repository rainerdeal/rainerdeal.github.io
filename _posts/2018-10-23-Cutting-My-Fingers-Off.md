##### Verse 1
I found a picture that we took when we brought in the new year  
It's hard to see but I remember  
You wore a cocktail dress  
Ignored the goosebumps on your neck  
The name sake of your outfit to keep you warm  

##### Verse 2
You always said that every thought I had was geometric  
I couldn't think outside my own lines  
I hope you're alright, and I'm sorry that I wasted your time  
Never had the intention to make you go  
Oo, oh oh, oh  

[Interlude]  

##### Verse 3
To make you go  
To make you go, to make you go  
I never wanted to make you go  
You might be a stranger now  
And I just wanted to let you know  
That I meant what I said  
And every dream I've ever had has been of myself  
And every dream I've ever had's been of a  
Better view with a ten month summer  
Losing you is like cutting my fingers off  

##### Outro
And even with that summer  
Without you I'd rather cut my fingers off
