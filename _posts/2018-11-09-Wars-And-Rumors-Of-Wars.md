Lucky for me, I wasn't raised in a religious household. I had the privilege of growing up with parents who would answer any question I had, permit me to read any book I wanted, and let me ultimately choose my own way of life. It seemed like common sense to me at the time, that a parent would have this attitude, but I was naive. I had met kids here and there who were being raised in conservative, religious households and they seemed normal, enough. It wasn't until I was more autonomous and older that I started noticing differences. From the kids who just seemed... _off_ to the ones who were clearly depressed and alienated from their peers. The differences between "normal" kids and "religious" kids became blatently obvious.

This dichotomy was sort of left alone until one day in biology class where my teacher had us debate the ethics of abortion. I remember us standing on opposite sides of the medium sized clasroom, not as individuals, but as tribes. In a class of about 25, there were maybe 5 **against** abortion and the rest defaulted to **for** abortion (and I specify "defaulted" because I think a handful just wanted to be in the majority). I don't remember any of what was said, but I do remember that those who were against abortion all had one thing in common, they were ALL religious. And the last thing I remember was that one or two of those kids had become so passionate in their "arguments" that by the time the bell rang, they were in tears, hopelessly trying to convince us that they were right.

Since then, I've grown accustomed to avoiding these people and when I can't, avoiding having any real discussions with them. The lesson to be learned wasn't whether abortion was ethical, but rather, a demonstration of how pointless it is to appeal to a person like that with facts and logic, because they beleive in something beyond reason. Somehow, what they _beleive_, trumps what others have _deduced_.

##### Tribalism êÉÜ

I think that we've become an increasingly tribal culture and I'm certainly not excempt from that accusation. I try to avoid subjecting myself to the likes of CNN too often, because I view it as _almost_ as bad as Fox News, at least as far as being obnoxiously partisan goes. At the very least it's not filled with white, middle aged, bimbos with boob jobs and lip injections. I try to get my news from varying sources as often as possible, but my favorite has always been NPR. Doesn't matter which station, just the local one. Though I loved the Pittsburgh one especially.

* I will definitely be writing about the culture shock of moving from urban Appalachia to DC at some point.

Lately I've been thinking about how we have been shoved into these vague categories of "left" or "right." If you consider the average Democrat and Republican, I don't think they differ too much from each other fiscally. They will have varying opinions from issue to issue, but you could probably find just as many Republicans or Democrats who's opinions vary in that regard. Really what separates them are social issues. But this is just an advanced form of prolefeed[^1] designed to target another audience (as opposed to regular prolefeed).

* Before you judge me for sounding like a centrist, I consider myself an anarcho-socialist.[^2]
* And yes, I did just learn how to do footnotes. üòé

This _may_ be a stretch, but I believe that the majority of Trump supporters don't actually care about or want to hurt minorities. I think they just want to improve their quality of life, **but** they have been fed lies about this foreign boogieman who will take it all away from them. Little do they know that the people who migrate to America also want the same thing! They should be on the same side. Their needs to be a shift in focus from social issues to class issues. And this is the perfect counter to the alt-right's brand of populism (read: fascism).
