I recently signed up for [Blue Apron](https://www.blueapron.com), on a whim. I've been eating out and buying lunch at work, more often lately. I'm finding it difficult to go to the grocery store and lost a lot of motivation to find recipes online and make them myself. I needed a change and I had heard of Blue Apron, through podcasts, so I was already thinking about trying it. And then another app I like to use, called [Acorns](https://www.acorns.com), had a promotion to sign up. So I'm giving it a shot for a couple weeks.

### How It Works
Blue Apron has a few options for their subscription model:
* 2 Person Meals (2 or 3 per week)
  * "Signature" (AKA: normal)
  * "Weight Watchers Freestyle"
* 4 Person Meals (2, 3, or 4 per week)

They also allow you to choose the day of the week for your delivery. And if you have a diet that doesn't include certain types of meat or any meat at all, they have you covered.

> I chose to go with the 2 person meals (3 per week) option, thinking that I would cook dinner and then save the other portion for lunch the next day. And this costs $60/week

All of the packaging that your food comes in is recyclable and the portions are measured out appropriately for each meal. I managed to recycle *almost* everything that I could reasonably be expected to wash, and wasted no food.

> In many areas, you must wash/rinse out your recycling. Check to see if that is required in your area!

### First Meal
##### Pesto Pasta with Broccoli & Lemon Ricotta

* Time: ~20 minutes
* Servings: 2
* Calories: 680 (per serving)

##### Ingredients:

* Lumaca Rigata Pasta (6 oz.)
* Broccoli (1/2 lb. or 1 head)
* Lemon (1)
* Garlic (2 cloves)
* Basil Peso (1/3 cup)
* Sliced Roasted Red Peppers (2 oz.)
* Ricotta Cheese (1/2 cup)
* Grated Parmesan Cheese (1/4 cup)
* Fromage Blanc (2 tbsp.)
* Crushed Red Pepper Flakes (1/4 tsp.)

##### Steps:

1. Prepare the ingredients:
    * Fill a medium post with salted water; cover and heat to boiling on high.
    * Wash and dry the fresh produce.
    * Roughly chop the broccoli.
    * Peel and roughly chop 2 cloves of garlic.
    * Quarter and deseed the lemon.
    * Roughly chop the peppers.
2. Cook the broccoli:
    * In a large pan, heat a drizzle of olive oil on medium-high until hot.
    * Add the chopped broccoli and garlic and as much of the red pepper flakes as you'd like. Season with salt & pepper.
    * Cook, stirring occasionally, 5-7 minutes, or until lightly browned and slightly softened.
    * Add 1/2 cup of water and cook, stirring occasionally, 3-4 minutes, or until the broccoli is softened and the water has cooked off. Turn off the heat.
3. Cook the pasta:
    * While the broccoli cooks, add the pasta to the pot of boiling water.
    * Cook, stirring occasionally, 8-10 minutes, or until al dente (still slightly firm to the bite).
    * Reserving 1/4 cup of the pasta cooking water, drain thoroughly.
4. Make the lemon ricotta:
    * While the pasta cooks, in a bowl, combine the ricotta cheese, half of the parmesan cheese, and the juice of 2 lemon wedges.
    * Season with salt & pepper.
5. Finish the pasta & serve your dish:
    * To the pan of cooked broccoli, add the cooked pasta, fromage blanc, and half the reserved pasta cooking water. Cook on medium-high, stirring constantly, 1-2 minutes, or until the pasta is coated.
    * Turn off the heat. Stir in the pesto and chopped peppers.
    * Taste, then season with salt & pepper if desired.
    * Serve the finished pasta topped with the lemon ricotta and remaining parmesan cheese. Serve the remaining lemon wedges on the side. Enjoy!

> I really wanted to add pictures, but I've messed up how I handle pictures in posts ðŸ™„ So I'll be working on that.

### Thoughts
* I'd like them to offer options for more (or less) portions. Currently they have no option that caters to people who live alone.
* Recycling is great, but reducing and reusing are *a lot* better. They could work on using less single-use plastic.
* My first meal was excellent! And they include wine pairing suggestions with the recipe.
  * Blue Apron also has a wine subscription.
